# Introduction

Space Wander Man is a compound project we submitted to the course of _Computer Graphics_, _Zhejiang University_.  
In the game, you would naviage through the universe we built, driving a spacescraft as a first person.  
Not only crash detection is implemented throught OpenGL, but also **_Wormhole Effect_**, through which you would be directed randomly to another unknown space.  

# Requirement

To run the program, we suggest you use Windows, since it depends on Windows libaraies.

If you organize the project under Visual Studio:

 1. Make sure OpenGL is correctly configures.
 2. Include all *.h files in your project.
 3. Add all *.cpp to your project.
 4. Ensure that your project finds the directory that store images.

**Compile the project and have fun!**
